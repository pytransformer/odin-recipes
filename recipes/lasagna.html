        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Preheat your oven to 375Â°F.
            </li>
            <li>
                Cook your lasagna noodles in a pot until al dente.
            </li>
            <li>
                In a saucepan, heat your marinara sauce.
            </li>
            <li>
                Sear the onion and garlic in a pan until brown.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add the ground beef and Italian sausage into the pan, and also sear until brown
            </li>
            <li>
                Add the meat, garlic, and onion to the marinara sauce
            </li>
            <li>
                In a mixing bowl, combine the ricotta cheese, shredded mozzarella cheese, grated Parmesan cheese, and any other desired ingredients like beaten eggs, salt, pepper, and herbs. Mix well to create a creamy cheese mixture.
            </li>
            <li>
                In a baking dish, spread a thin layer of sauce on the bottom to prevent sticking. Layer the lasagna noodles evenly over the sauce. Spread a layer of the cheese mixture over the noodles, followed by another layer of sauce. Repeat the layers until you've used all your ingredients, finishing with a layer of sauce on top.
            </li>
            <li>
                Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil and place it in the preheated oven. Bake for about 30-40 minutes, or until the lasagna is bubbly and the cheese is melted. If you like a crispy top, you can remove the foil during the last 10 minutes of baking.
            </li>
            <li>
                Once the lasagna is done, remove it from the oven and let it rest for about 10 minutes before slicing and serving. This allows the lasagna to set and makes it easier to serve.
            </li>
            <li>
                Cut the lasagna into portions and serve hot. Garnish with fresh herbs or additional grated Parmesan cheese if desired.
            </li>
        </ol>
