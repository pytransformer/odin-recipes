        <h2>Description</h3>
        <p>First, mince Dill Pickle relish and onions into very fine pieces. Stir these with paprika, vinegar, salt, mustard, ketchup, and mayo to make the spread and let it sit. Ground the beef into ground beef. Then, mould the ground beef into small balls, then flatten them using wax paper on both sides. After that, toast your buns on a pan with butter until they are crispy. On another pan, cook the patties with salt until a brown crust appears. Add American cheese on them, and let the cheese melt slightly. Then, spread the sauce on the bottom bun. Finally, assemble the patties with the buns, lettuce, sliced tomato, and sliced onion and you're done. </p>
